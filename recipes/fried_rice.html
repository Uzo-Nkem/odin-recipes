<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nigerian fried rice recipe is one of the best exports out of Africa. It is perfectly okay to call this recipe West African fried rice because we generally cook fried rice the same way across West Africa – Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Togo, Cotonou, etc. You can also call this dish vegetable fried rice because it uses tons of veggies, and you can easily make this fried rice recipe vegan by swapping only one ingredient (yes, it is that easy).</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons coconut/groundnut/other vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 cups raw & washed rice, long grain or basmati</li>
    <li>3-4 cups Nigerian-style stock</li>
    <li>1 cup onions and carrots, diced (hard veggies)</li>
    <li>1 cup spring onions, bell peppers, sweetcorn, peas, chopped (soft mixed veggies)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Nigerian/West Indian/Caribbean curry powder (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1/4 black or white pepper </li>
    <li>1/4 turmeric powder </li>
    <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shrimp or prawn, seasoned and sautéed </li>
    <li>1/2 cup liver, diced and cooked (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup green bell pepper, diced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the rice and sauté for 3-5 minutes, until toasted.</li>
    <li>Add 2 cups of stock to the rice, stir and cook on low heat, with the lid on for 12-15 minutes, or till stock is absorbed and rice has softened a bit. Let cool for 5-10 minutes, then fluff and set aside.</li>
    <li>In another pot, heat up the remaining 2 tablespoons oil till hot, then add the hard vegetables. Season with a pinch of salt and stir fry for 2-3 minutes before you add the soft mixed vegetables. Let cook, another 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Season to taste with curry powder, dried thyme, black/white pepper, turmeric powder.
    </li>
    <li>Add the rice and stir gently, but well, so rice and vegetables combine. Add 1 cup of stock and the coconut milk, cover the pot and cook on low-medium heat for 10-15 minutes or till the rice is al dente.</li>
    <li>Check for doneness and seasoning, and adjust accordingly. Add more stock if required.</li>
    <li>When rice is ready, stir in chopped liver, sautéed shrimp and diced green bell peppers. Cook for 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat and serve.</li>
