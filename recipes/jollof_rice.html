<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Everyone has their version of this popular West African dish, so here’s ours. It’s filled with punchy, vibrant flavours and complements the equally spicy baked chicken perfectly.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>250g long grain rice</li>
    <li>500ml chicken stock</li>
    <li>400g chopped tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 red pepper</li>
    <li>1 scotch bonnet chilli</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>A couple of sprigs of Fresh thyme + a few extra to serve</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
    <li>540g chicken legs and thighs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Parboil the rice with 500ml of the chicken stock for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. The rice will still be slightly hard.</li>
    <li>Blend the pepper, onion, tomatoes and scotch bonnet to a smooth paste.</li>
    <li>Pre-heat the oven at 190°C/fan 170°C/gas mark 5.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil, and add the paste along with the curry powder, leaves from the thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Cook on a medium heat for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Put the chicken pieces on a tray with a drizzle of oil and a spoonful of the sauce you just made for each piece of chicken. Bake in the oven for 35 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the parboiled rice to the sauce with the rest of the stock. Cover and cook for a further 15 minutes. Give it a stir after 10 minutes and add more stock if it feels sticky.</li>
    <li>Once the chicken has cooked, add to the rice to serve up with some more of the fresh thyme.</li>
</ol>
